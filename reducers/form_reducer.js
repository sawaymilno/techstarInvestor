This is why we started 2ULaundry. \r\n\r\nNow with a simple text, your laundry and/or dry cleaning will be picked up from right outside your front door, cleaned to your exact preferences, and delivered back the very next day…giving you time back to do what matters most in life.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you're thinking \"hasn't this been done before\" The answer is yes…Dan D'Aquisto and Alex Smereczniak launched 2ULaundry in January of 2016 after seeing two companies raise money to go after the $35B laundry / dry cleaning space with the wrong models. Prior to launching 2ULaundry, Alex started and sold another laundry startup at Wake Forest University that utilized static, scheduled routes. These static routes coupled with employing 3rd shift labor and operating in underutilized laundromats has allowed 2ULaundry to produce over $250K in monthly revenue, reach profitability in its first market, and partner with the worlds largest appliance manufacturer to vertically integrate the supply chain with minimal capex.",

  "description": "Companies are spending billions of dollars a year just to get reliable answers to their legal and regulatory questions. Yes, the law is complex, and yes, making informed decisions is important. But knowing the law should not be this difficult and expensive! Well, the age of automation in legal is here, and Alexsei is how it's happening. \r\n\r\nAnswering a legal question involves reviewing tens-to-hundreds of documents, including case law, legislation, textbooks, etc., and summarizing the key concepts. It is slow and tedious. But this isn't even the worst part. What's most broken about this process is that it's being repeated by lawyers all over to answer the same questions. \r\n\r\nBy scaling a service using a human-in-the-loop AI process, Alexsei is resolving this fragmentation in the market, and building a generalized AI that can answer any legal question.",

  "description": "Problem\r\n•\tOnce upon a time banks CIB businesses were super profitable : capital was plenty and cheap and regulation was really friendly. And then came 2008, and all that came to a halt : banks CIB businesses entered the dark financial “ice age”. Some CIB businesses even saw their profitability crashed from 20% down to 7%.\r\n•\tFast forward to 2018 : now that banks are looking for innovative startup technologies to boost their CIB businesses bottom-line, their last 10-years intense focus on regulation and compliance has created a wealth of…RegTech and ComplianceTech startups. So that very few startups actually focus their technology on this current and pressing need.\r\nSolution\r\nWe at ALGOSAVE – because we are all former CIB and asset-management specialists – fill in this yawning gap and offer solutions to do exactly that : boost the profitability of banks once thriving CIB businesses. ALGOSAVE FinTech directly improves - in a transparent and auditable way - a number of decision-making processes, which are currently based upon backward-looking regulatory view instead of a forward-looking stance : point-in-time credit ratings, risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC) pricing and economic capital (EC) forecast. Those improvement immediately allow our clients to :\r\n•\tBoost their CIB business profitability by doubling their volume of CIB business while using the same amount of capital; benefiting from ALGOSAVE superior estimates of portfolio-wide joint-default probabilities as well as single corporate scenario-sensitive and seniority-specific Loss Given Default full term-structure. The later also cuts down traditional IFRS9/CECL Expected Credit Losses estimates, once again, boosting CIB businesses bottom line.\r\n•\tSecure the highest margin and best quality CIB business while generously leaving the rest … to competition.\r\n•\tAchieve and secure competitive advantage in corporate loan underwriting; benefiting from ALGOSAVE proprietary loan covenants and collateral design platform.",

The sleep scheduling monitor keeps a record of when the baby is sleeping and waking up over time. This helps the parents schedule when to put the baby down for naps and night time sleep. AmpIdea sells the monitor hardware and charges for additional services.",

Hardware has improved dramatically but software is still antiquated and highly complex. This is the primary issue holding desktop 3D printers from reaching mass adoption.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nAstroPrint licenses software to 3D printer manufacturers in the same way that Microsoft licenses Windows to computer manufacturers. This software makes any 3D printer easy to use, allowing manufacturers to sell to non-technical people.  In addition, this standardizes the process of 3D Printing as well as how developers interact with 3D Printers.\r\n\r\nThe software also connects printers to our cloud platform, 3DP 'App Store', and APIs.  This lets end-users find millions of 3D models with a simple point and click interface, and developers can build custom applications for the 3DP industry.",

  "description": "We are building a platform to crowd-source trading strategies. We restructure trading into a data and math problem by abstracting out finance knowledge - for example, a problem to predict buy/sell signal on a stock can be re-framed as a 0/1 classification problem on time series data. \r\nThis allows anyone with data and/or math skills to analyze historical data to discover patterns and build models without any experience in finance - opening up a big pool of users for us.\r\nTo make this interesting for users, we turn problems into online competition, QuantQuest, where our community of students, data scientists, developers, quants etc solve them for cash prizes, profit shares and other rewards.\r\nAnyone can use our free tutorials (medium.com/auquan) and open source backtesting toolbox (bitbucket.org/auquan/auquantoolbox) to learn about and solve these trading problems. \r\nProfitable strategies created by our users are used by our trading partners to trade live in the markets. We charge these trading firms a percentage cut in the profits and reward our users by splitting this fee equally between the user and Auquan.\r\n\r\nAs more trading and investment management firms around the world switch to quantitative style of trading, the demand for quantitative researchers to discover and implement newer trading ideas is also on the rise. Our solution serves this demand with latent talent - skilled people with analytical backgrounds who can draw on skills from their respective fields to collaboratively design highly successful trading strategies. By asking people to only solve a part of the problem, we motivate them to use what they know, draw on their existing skills, allowing a larger set of users with very specific problem solving skills to work on problems specific to their domain. A math student can work on the optimization part of the problem, a data scientist can work on the data analysis and prediction part of the problem and a developer can work on the writing superior algorithms. \r\nWith our finance domain knowledge, we can ensemble and build on their solutions to come up with well-optimized strategies.",

Autobon’s vision is to ultimately automate the highway portion of long-haul trips with our Autopilot platform that has already proven Level 2 autonomous capabilities.\r\n\r\nAutobon utilizes a suite of video and thermal cameras, radar, and GPS to feed data into its proprietary software solution – enabling driver assist and real-time asset management to commercial trucking operators.  This platform unlocks enhanced visibility with 360 video views around the vehicle for both the drivers and fleet owners, as well as a 25% reduction in insurance premiums for commercial trucking fleets. In addition, Autobon’s platform empowers a larger pool of drivers to safely and effectively operate semi-trucks by providing safety assistance features such lane departure and forward collision warnings.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate vision of automating the highway portion of the long-haul delivery will further alleviate the pressure on truck fleet owners to find sufficient and qualified long-haul drivers. Drivers are seeking to spend more time at home and with their families, and this will allow them to focus on the shorter routes upon exiting the highways.",

Where our ecosystem is completely integrated into a domestic or global market, farmers would profit, food losses would decrease, food prices would decrease, and food availability would increase.\"",

There are high barriers to energy and infrastructure investing, meaning that it has traditionally only been large institutional investors who can access this asset class directly. For sponsors, there is a gap in financing options for small and medium sized projects and a lack of flexible funding sources, limiting the execution of their project pipeline. More fundamentally, the world needs innovative solutions to mitigate climate change, stem its worst impacts and provide real economic growth.

Because of this, building standards require new and retrofitting constructions to create a Building Energy Model --- a forecast of the energy usage in the building. This is great for the climate, but terrible for construction timelines.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that energy models are extremely complex and need input from architects, engineers, and energy analysts. They all use different softwares with no quality assurance and no version control. Each change request can take hundreds of hours to update. These delays cost the industry upwards of $300 million dollars every year.\r\n\r\nBuildSimHub provides an automatic modeling workflow that streamlines data integration, creates transparent communication, and provides version control for a collaborative modeling process. This allows faster and more accurate project management, shortening the modeling cycle up to 50%, thus saving our customers $10,000 per building project in average.",

We believe decentralisation will be a major trend in the upcoming decades and as such we focus our efforts on technologies to empower people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’re creating a new generation of 3D printers that operate using a new process we have invented and patented called Physical Mask Curing. This process, PMC for short, is enabling us to build printers that are high resolution, have a lower investment cost and are completely scalable. This means we can build printers that are mobile and field ready with no computer or internet required, right up to industrial devices with much larger build volumes than ever seen before.",

So we set out to make these processes faster and easier… but quickly realised that if a better solution existed we would already be using it. So we started experimenting with completely new ways to make circuits and came up with the process the Argentum uses.\r\n\r\nAlthough we all do a bit of everything we all have a core role in the company.

A dog with a job is a happy dog, and our technology enriches pets' lives by having them play for their food. In the process, pet parents feel better about leaving their family members alone at home, and through the CleverPet platform our customers develop a radically improved relationship to the animals they share their lives with.</p>\r\nThe companion animals market is massive, growing, and recession-proof. As of 2015 it's more than $60B/year in the US alone, and there are now more pet dogs in America than kids and young adults under age 20. People leave their dogs lonely and sad for 10s of billions of hours each year, and feel so guilty about it they spend $40/day and bring their dog to \"dog daycare\". We're taking cognitive behavioral training technology previously available only to researchers, and bringing it into the home to provide pets with the daily mental and physical stimulation they crave.",

  "description": "Codestarter is the first nonprofit accepted into Techstars, and we are so proud to be a part of the Techstars family. \r\n\r\nAt Codestarter, we focus on getting laptops (Acer C720s running Linux) into the hands and \r\nhomes of kids who want to learn to code, but who don’t have their own hardware. To do this, we partner with organizations that teach programming, such as CoderDojo. These programs are instrumental for developing the next generation of thinkers and builders, but these classes only scratch the surface and create exposure to coding. Giving a child ownership of her own laptop emboldens her to immerse herself in learning. Plus, it’s hard to become a hacker when you only get to code for an hour once a week on a borrowed piece of equipment.\r\n\r\nOn our website (codestarter.org), we crowdfund one laptop at a time. Every time we hit $250 in donations, we will ship a Chromebook pre-loaded with Linux to a child who is waiting to enroll in a programming class. When the child receives her laptop, she’ll send you a thank-you note, and you’ll get quarterly updates on her progress for the first year as she learns to code. We want to provide complete transparency, so we’ll also give you access to our evaluation data. This way you can check in and see the long-term impact of giving laptops to kids and empowering them to code. \r\n\r\nThink back to when you got your first computer. How old were you? Did that opportunity make a difference in your life? If it did, and you or your company wants to give that same opportunity to some really great kids, join us! At Codestarter, we want to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn how to code. And it all starts with a computer.",

  "description": "It all started 5 years ago when cofounder Daniel was trying to access his purchasing data from Safeway. They said there was no way to access the data digitally, but if he sent them a $1 check with a handwritten letter that they would mail him a copy of his records. A couple weeks later, a stack of papers showed up and he realized that wasn’t going to work for our version of a digital pantry. \r\n\r\nIn 2017 it became evident that grocers were moving into the digital age and Daniel discovered that it is now possible to connect directly to 80+ of the largest grocers in the United States and download all of our purchases.\r\n\r\nWhen a user connects Cooklist to a store they shop at, their last few months of purchases are downloaded immediately, and then anytime they go to the store in the future those purchases are downloaded as well. Cooklist keeps track of how old everything is, and sends notifications when food is about to expire.\r\n\r\nBut what if we could invite chefs from all over the world into our kitchen and see their ideas for what meals we can cook with the food in our home?\r\n\r\nWe crawled the internet and collected 1.3 million recipes. Then we trained a series of natural language processing models to match each product in our pantry to recipe ingredients. The result is that users can open Cooklist and see thousands of recipes they can cook with the products already in their home. \r\n\r\nBut what should I buy?\r\n\r\nThe manual process of planning meals for the week, tallying up the ingredients needed to make a shopping list and going to the grocery store takes a ton of time.\r\n\r\nCooklist automates this process so users can simply choose the recipes they want to cook and Cooklist generates a shopping cart with all the products they need to buy. And since we are at the unique point in time where grocers are going digital we can pre-populate the online shopping carts at multiple grocers and make it easy to place an order for curbside pickup or delivery.\r\n\r\nCooklist launched the first beta in September of 2017 as a webapp and launched the beta iOS app in April 2018. The average user connects to 3 stores, downloads $400 worth of purchases per month and uses Cooklist 4 times per week.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, our mission is to help people eat intelligently. Cooklist combines the intelligence of a personal chef, a personal shopper and a personal nutritionist into a service that anticipates users’ needs and helps them reach their dietary and monetary goals.",

  "description": "EcoG is the future cloud-based platform to enable shared revenue streams and value added services in fast charging and beyond.\r\nOur asset is the combined charging system (CCS) control stack in each CCS fast charger (>22kW) combining data from the vehicle, the local user, the grid and the operator.\r\nOur solution consists of two parts: the EcoG SW stack in the chargers and the EcoG cloud platform. EcoG controls the charging process, provides connectivity and data processing. It provides value add services to stakeholders and conducts the accounting for those services. EcoG is enabling the move to shared continuous revenue streams instead of one-time sales.\r\nEcoG resolves the pain points and creates additional revenue streams for \r\nOperators, site owners, charger manufactures and chipset manufacturers.\r\nOperators and site owners create extra revenue by value add services. e.g. carbon credits: generates additional 0.4$ in 15min fast charging (resulting in 3000$ per charger and year). They gain differentiation by providing own services, e.g. customer app for local referral services and participate in the revenue stream created by the user during the charging stop, e.g. shopping mall, fitness centre etc.\r\nCharger manufacturers profit from in the cost reduction for maintenance with monitoring and predictive maintenance services as well as a reduced BOM for controller.\r\nEcoG itself benefits from revenue based on the accounting in the EcoG Cloud, energy consumption and shared revenue stream across the stakeholders (1st service: Carbon Credit accounting and payment, 2nd referral marketing and 3rd location-based advertising).\r\nThe market for electric vehicle charging is developing already today. There are more than 3,500 high power charging stations available in the US and more than 8,500 in Europe. The CCS standard has the highest growth rate in vehicles and chargers. In 2020, in the US the power revenue of EVs are estimated with 1B$ value with 6.2 M EVs on the street. And in 2030, estimations calculate 18 Mio. charging stations world-wide (DC & AC combined). Several programs and initiatives drive the growth further: (i) Electrify America alone invests 2B$ in charging infrastructure the next three years (ii) California invests 1.5 B$ for charging infrastructure in the next five years and (iii) Europe invests approx. 1.8B€ in the setup of a European charging infrastructure until 2020.\r\nEcoG is providing the platform and software stack for the future of electric mobility.",

  "description": "We've all felt it. That room or floor in our homes that are too hot or cold.  They are simply uncomfortable.  This is because in a majority of homes in this country, heating and cooling systems are forced air (or central air).  These systems are either all on, or all off.  This is inefficient because you're heating and cooling empty space, but it's also very comfortable because these systems have no understanding of your home.  We've built an entirely wireless, user installed system of sensors that detect the climate in each room in your home, and vents which automatically open and close.  As a user, you plug in sensors (one into each room), and replace your existing vents with our new ones.  Then you use our app to control every room in your home independently, shut empty rooms off, or just let the house optimize for savings.  It's that simple.  In a few hours, you can have room by room temperature control in the home!",

Elegus Technologies, Inc is the exclusive licensee of the Kevlar®-based nanotechnology developed at the University of Michigan. This platform technology is housed within Elegus Technologies, though it has many potential applications within the field of energy storage.  \r\n\r\nThe first -- and most promising -- application of this technology is as a separator within lithium-ion batteries. Plastic separators have long been the incumbent technology inside lithium-ion batteries. However, as battery manufacturers are looking to extend the life of their batteries, separator solutions beyond traditional plastics are required. Heat and safety issues, most recently with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, can still result when battery manufacturers use plastic separators inside high-energy batteries. Our separators, at about ⅔ the cost of the plastic incumbent, can increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries by an estimated 30%, on top of added safety benefits. This is because our separator can be produced at half the thickness (or more) of the plastic alternative, while maintaining strength and safety.",

This allows our clients to identify and target areas of strategic and financial growth.\r\n\r\n>> Guide referrals to highest value in-network providers. Our provider-patient matching algorithms deliver critical network, quality, cost, and accessibility data to the point of care. This reduces leakage by guiding referrals the highest value in-network providers.\r\n\r\n>> Efficiently manage referrals with rule-based workflows. We replace inefficient, often paper-based workflows with transparent scalable workflows - built by physicians for physicians. Our workflow can be embedded in existing EMR workflows or deployed as a stand-alone web application. This allows providers to manage referrals across a provider network where EMRs may not otherwise connect.\r\n\r\n>> Monitor performance and take action with real-time analytics.

  "description": "What is FitDeck Mobile?\r\nFitDeck Mobile is a fitness application that runs on mobile devices (including Android, BlackBerry and iPhone) and provides an effective and convenient full-body workout that can be done anywhere, anytime. It presents a unique set of exercises in a program with structure and variety that is as fun and easy to use as a deck of cards.\r\n\r\nWhat exercises are included in the FitDeck Mobile application?\r\nFitDeck Mobile’s flagship title, Bodyweight, contains 50 body-weight resistance exercises that require no weights or special equipment to perform, so they can be done in virtually any setting (office, home, gym, hotel room, park, etc.). The individual exercises are categorized by body region and have strength, flexibility, and cardio components to ensure a comprehensive, full-body workout.\r\n\r\nPilates, Office and Stairs are also currenlty available. Other FitDeck Mobile titles that are coming soon include: Navy SEAL, Dumbbell, Exercise Ball, Stretch, Combat Sports, Yoga, Resistance Tube, Kettlebell, Pull Up, Junior, Firefighter, Balance Dome, Senior, Travel, Toning Ball, Postnatal, Exercise Bar, Superman, Playground, Prenatal, Baby Stroller, TRX Suspension Trainer, Medicine Ball, Speed, Agility, Quickness, CrossTrain, Plyometrics, Speed Ladder, Vertical Jump, Core Blast, and Cones.\r\n\r\nWhat are examples of some of the exercises?\r\nFitDeck Mobile features many innovative exercises with unique body positions and movements along with surprising and interesting variations on more traditional exercises like push-ups, jumping jacks, and sit-ups. Mixed together, these exercises are remarkably effective at conditioning major muscle groups and joints from head to toe, as well as targeting those muscles you never knew you had. To learn more, download a free trial at www.fitdeckmobile.com.\r\n\r\nWhat type of person is FitDeck Mobile intended for?\r\nFitDeck Mobile provides a great workout for people of all fitness and activity levels because it offers several different intensities â€“ beginner, intermediate and advanced â€“ to suit any user’s present level and keep them challenged as they advance. Additionally, variations on certain exercises are suggested to better match each user’s ability.\r\n\r\nWhat mobile devices are currently compatible with FitDeck Mobile?\r\nFitDeck Mobile is available now for BlackBerry and Android along with an increasing majority of other cell phones and mobile devices. FitDeck Mobile for the Apple iPhone/iPod Touch is expected to be available by March 2011.\r\n\r\nHow do I know if it will work on my mobile device?\r\nPotential users can visit www.fitdeckmobile.com and use the device selection wizard to check for compatibility with FitDeck Mobile. From that point, a fully functional trial version of the product can be installed in most cases, so the user can take a test drive to see how it functions and get in a few workouts at no cost.\r\n\r\nWhere can I buy FitDeck Mobile and how much does it cost?\r\nFitDeck Mobile is available from the FitDeck Mobile website (www.fitdeckmobile.com), as well as other App Stores including: Android Market and BlackBerry App World. In any case, the one-time purchase of under $10 gives unlimited access to any available FitDeck Mobile title. That means that for less than you’d pay for a single month at a gym, you get lifelong fitness benefits that go with you anywhere your mobile device does.\r\n\r\nWhy did mobileXware develop FitDeck Mobile?\r\nThe founders of mobileXware are into health and fitness and are also accustomed to an on-the-go lifestyle. They use FitDeck Mobile regularly and wanted to share this easy and effective fitness concept with like-minded consumers. People have their mobile devices with them everywhere these days, so why not utilize that technology to ensure that fitness remains a part of their ever more hectic lives?\r\n\r\nHow does FitDeck Mobile relate to FitDeck cards and other products?\r\nThrough a growing partnership, FitDeck Mobile takes the same great content (developed by a certified personal trainer/Navy SEAL) featured in the FitDeck exercise playing cards and delivers it in a convenient digital form. Regardless of the format, the FitDeck workouts provide the ultimate combination of simplicity, effectiveness, and convenience that is unmatched by any other product.",

Consumers spend more than $600b/year dining out and more than $500b/year in grocery stores, but there is virtually no longitudinal or latitudinal data on their behavior in restaurants. Existing consumer data relies on 40-year old market research techniques that bias the data and lack the scale of modern web technologies – it’s qualitative, lacks granularity, and can’t be predictive.\r\n\r\nFood Genius is on a mission to help everyone love what they eat.

Through this focus, Gimme has created a platform that has attracted extremely engaged users who love the service and keep coming back for more.   The company launched the world’s first 24/7 metal service as its flagship community, Gimme Radio (www.gimmeradio.com and available as an iOS and Android app), on June 29, 2017.  In under a year we have amassed an army of 30K hyper-engaged fans and a roster of +50 DJs that include Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, and Dave Catching of Eagles of Death Metal.  Funds are being raised to support the long term vision to expand beyond metal and into other music genres and fan segments.",

Coming from diverse backgrounds, Global EIR is proud to provide mentors to programs that enable women, people of color, and first-generation college students to acquire the skills they need to get their first internships and jobs in the tech industry.\r\n\r\nTo date, Global EIR programs have successfully received visas for over 30 founders at a 100% success rate. Global EIR has partnerships with 13 universities in six states, and companies affiliated with Global EIR have raised over $180M in private capital and have created over 400 jobs, including $8.5M in new funding and 58 new jobs. \r\n\r\nGlobal EIR went through the Techstars Boulder 2017 program as their first nonprofit.",

The outcome is increasingly familiar: massive public embarrassment and reputational damage for the organizations who were hacked, enormous regulatory fines and financial damage, and often career-ending professional (and in some cases, criminal) repercussions for the CIOs, CISOs, and even CEOs held responsible for failing to defend their data adequately.\r\n\r\nGreatHorn is a new cloud security platform that specifically solves these problems. With multiple customers in production, a data set comprised of hundreds of thousands of emails and authentication events, and simple deployment options for popular systems such as Google Apps and AWS, GreatHorn reduces the time, cost, and effort required to prevent spear phishing and credential theft attacks. Built on a foundation of world-class machine learning, the GreatHorn platform uses a range of sophisticated algorithms and techniques to detect the kinds of emails and authentication events that are missed by most other solutions, and does so in real-time, with automated response actions and no impact on end user productivity.",

To combat this, Guardion is developing city scale radiation monitoring - to detect a dirty bomb as it moves through a city or better yet the materials used to make a dirty bomb before they could be weaponized. To do this, we have the world first radiation detector that exploits quantum properties of nanomaterials allowing us to build a low cost, sensitive, and low power detector that is uniquely able to be deployed at such a large scale.\r\n\r\nWinner: MassChallenge Gold Prize, 2017\r\nWinner: CASIS/Boeing Prize to carry out research on the International Space Station\r\nWinner: TechPlanter Competition\r\nNational Science Foundation I-Corps Team, DC Node",

Now a team of six, featuring two more uni buddies and two developers hired through their platform, hackajob is on a mission to connect the best technical talent with the most exciting companies, globally.\r\n\r\nThe first line of code was written in November, an MVP was released in mid December (it looked ugly mind and, note to self, Christmas is not a good time to release a MVP) and 7 months later they can claim clients as big as the BBC and Argos, as well as a European unicorn in Transferwise. Their community has grown to over 10,000 techies, featuring developers, data scientists, testers and more, based within the UK and EU. They have exciting plans to take hackajob global, allowing more direct employers to engage with top tech talent that their businesses require to drive growth.",

  "description": "Halo is a free fleet management dashboard which let's fleet operators order and pay for services such as fuel delivery, car washing, maintenance, and other conveniences in just a few clicks from an app without the need for aftermarket hardware.\r\n\r\nThe 10 million US vehicle fleet are not owned by large, central companies. 80% of fleets are small, less than 100 cars, and growing at an incredible 17% CAGR. Part of what’s driving this growth, and a shift to smaller fleets that are distributed throughout cities, is distributed car renting and car sharing companies. But the moment Zipcar solved the convenience problem by bringing cars from the airport, to parking lots near their customers 18 years ago, it created a whole new set of problems.\r\n\r\nHow do you monitor, maintain, and service this ‘distributed fleet’? To solve this, the incumbent ‘Fleet Management & Asset Tracking' companies applied the same tools that worked for semi-trucks, but it wasn’t cheap. The ‘smart fleet management’ sector now costs fleet owners $340 Bn / year. A lot of that expense comes from hardware and connectivity expenses needed to connect fleets to those antiquated, enterprise software systems. Because these incumbents started with massive fleets of vehicles, they assumed that the fleets have negotiated their own service contracts or simply employ their own service staff, so virtually none of these solutions connect to outside services.\r\n\r\n***Simply put, fleet management software is expensive, depends on hardware, and doesn’t connect to services.***\r\n\r\nHalo is free, connects to services, and requires no aftermarket hardware to operate.\r\nWe make a commission on the services delivered to our customers by our service provider partners.\r\n\r\nWe get the car location and lock/unlock access to perform this service through the same portal that the automaker's apps like Tesla, BMW ConnectedDrive, or OnStart connect through.\r\n\r\nFor service providers, they get an application that brings them free customers, directs them to the specific location of the cars they need to service, gives them temporary vehicle unlock access to do the services so there is no need to track down key, a photo inspection tool they use before and after the service, and automated receipt/invoicing once the service is done and the car is locked.",

  "description": "Hammerhead effortlessly guides you to and through great bike routes. By using intuitive light patterns to display directions and social data, we are able to dramatically cut down on the clutter of the navigation experience. And by creating cyclist-centric mapping, we are building a global network of safe bike routes with relevant, meaningful information for bikers. The future of cycling is here, and it is simply beautiful.\r\n\r\nWith Hammerhead bikers can:\r\n\r\nGet from where they are to where they need to be\r\nSimply find and follow the safest bike routes\r\nShare and discover new rides with friends and community\r\nExplore the world on their bicycle\r\nHammerhead’s founder Piet biked across the United States in 2006 as part of a trip that tragically claimed the lives of several of his Yale classmates. Several years and many miles of riding later, Piet resolved to create a good way to find safe bike routes.\r\n\r\nAfter building the initial Hammerhead prototype, Piet set about building a team equal to his vision. He began with his high school biking friend Laurence, then finishing his masters in Engineering at Brown. Piet then chanced upon Raveen at a hackathon in Pennsylvania, and tracked down Jon on a stopover from his travels in India. The new team moved into a one-bedroom apartment with a total budget of $15,000 on which to live and to build Hammerhead. They emerged 5 months later with a successful crowdfunding campaign that raised over $190 000 in pre orders from over 35 nations. This is the team that is going to change the face of navigation, starting with cycling.",

  "description": "HelixAI helps scientists and researchers do their science better! \r\n\r\nWhile conducting experiments, researchers need to access  and to record critical information in real time.  This can be safety information about a chemical they are working with, a note they previously made for themselves, or the next step they need to complete their experiment successfully.  Up until now, they simply have not had the tools to accomplish these tasks in real time without costly interruptions to their work.  Stopping an experiment to access information can lead to human error,  contamination and failed experiments; all resulting in significant loss of time and money, and an opportunity to create a better way. \r\n \r\nHelixAI is introducing voice and artificial intelligence into the laboratory to give scientists the support they need, when they need it, and empower them to do even more.\r\n\r\nWe work directly with bio-pharmaceutical companies to create custom voice assistants that are unique to each organization.  Our system analyzes an organization's custom experimental procedures, chemical information, inventories and other scientific data to create a voice interaction model.  This interaction model is integrated into a natural language and speech recognition platform to create a voice application or \"skill\".  The skill is deployed directly to devices within the organization and in the lab, scientists interact with our assistants through smart speaker devices like the Echo, Echo Dot, or Echo Show.  All completely hand's free.\r\n\r\nA Helix voice assistant helps bio-pharmaceutical organizations increase productivity by reducing failed experiments due to human error, reduce the time it takes for them to bring new drugs to market by improving accuracy and reproducibility and better compliance and regulatory requirements by providing automated documentation of experiments.",

It is suitable for both the direct and video techniques and operated entirely by the left-hand, freeing up the right-hand to pass the breathing tube. The Inscope will wirelessly transmit video to a nearby tablet, allowing an indirect view of the vocal cords and breathing tube placement verification.",

To enable the creation of affordable insurance covers, Jamii has built a mobile policy management platform that performs 90% of insurance administration activities, as well as building strategic partnerships with telecoms and local insurance companies. This technology approach drastically cuts insurance administration and distribution costs. \r\n\r\nPremium payments and hospital claims are also administered through mobile money. Customers can choose between three-month and six-month cover policies based on their budget and number of dependents. Jamii believes in the right of low-income earners to access hospital care and health insurance to improve their quality of life.

  "description": "Kytelabs is re-imagining the smart home by giving it a touch of humanity. While many believe the smart home is about wireless control, we know it’s much more than that. It is about the connection between a person and their home and the interactions that happen within it. Our belief is that a smart home is one that understands you and uses that information to help you live your life. The team is comprised of three highly capable computer engineers with over 5 years of experience working together. Collectively they’ve built all sorts of things from laser engraving CNC’s to umbrellas that warn you when it’s going to rain. They are best known for their BLE development board, the BLEduino, that was successfully crowd-funded on Kickstarter.\r\n\r\nThe Team\r\n\r\nJonathan –  the “designer” in the group with a specialty in UX and front-end web technologies. Prior to Kytelabs he worked at Microsoft as a Program Manager under the user experience team and has a deep passion for making hardware that is simple and easy to use. He holds a bachelor in computer engineering and a minor in economics with some training from Harvard Business School.\r\n\r\nRamon –  lives for startups and customer development. He is the mobile and back-end guy in the group. He’s always learning about the latest databases and web frameworks as well as everything Bluetooth 4.0 and iOS He has experience working at IBM and researching at MIT Lincoln Labs. He’s won several entrepreneurship awards and built one previous startup, Stography (stography.com).\r\n\r\nAngel – is passionate about embedded systems and open source hardware.. He is the hardware specialist of the group. Before Kytelabs he taught himself about electronics, worked at IBM making pretty things (front-end web development), and has been very active in the open hardware community. Extremely skilled in PCB and electronics design and can hand-solder just about anything.",

  "description": "MakerBloks is a Montreal-based startup that aims to empower children everywhere to become the creators, rather than just the consumers, of technology. We do this by designing innovative games that tap into children’s natural play patterns. We combine physical building blocks with a storytelling app that encourages kids to build with their hands, while learning with a story. The result is that children begin to create their own games and take ownership of the technology they’re using. Having graduated at the top of the first Canadian cohort of the Founder Institute, we see ourselves as the first step for the creative and curious minds of the next generation. \r\n \r\nThe Hardware:\r\nMakerBloks is our first product, and with it we introduce kids to the world of electricity and electronics. Colorful, interactive and magnetic building blocks allow kids as young as 6 years old to learn about circuitry in a fun and safe way. The blocks snap together flawlessly with our proprietary connectors, and are color-coded by function for easy identification. We have three themed kits: Circuitry Kit, Spy Kit and Music Kit. Every kit includes 26 blocks, and has it’s own set of special projects to build, like a lie detector test, a keyboard, or a Simon Says game.\r\n\r\nThe Software:\r\nWe have developed a story app that complements our building blocks to create a more immersive learning experience. The story challenges children to help the on-screen characters solve puzzles by using their physical MakerBloks. For example, children learn to fix lights on a car, or turn the sound down on a movie set by following the story and building real circuits with their blocks. The communication between the blocks and the story is achieved with our unique application of Bluetooth technology. With a monthly subscription, kids can receive new stories directly on their tablet - giving MakerBloks the best replay value. The app gives children access to even more educational information about the components they use,  and allows them to experiment freely with their blocks to unlock different bonuses. To make this happen, we’ve built our own license and original storylines, with a method that could be easily adapted to other popular licences through partnerships.\r\n \r\nOur goal is to create playful and fun experiences that empower kids to take ownership of the technology that surrounds them.",

Every purchase on MiniMonos supplies clean water to kids in India (over 14,000 days to date); weâ€™ve adopted orangutans and supported wild tigers, and kids get in-world rewards for real-world eco-actions.\r\n\r\nThe site, which launched out of beta April 1, 2011, has been growing by more than 20% per month for the past nine months and now has more than 300,000 registered members; it is generating revenue through subscriptions and microtransactions from its target market of 8-12-year-old boys. The top four countries for registrations are the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand; memberships are being driven through natural traffic (word of mouth), Google Adwords, the Miniclip games aggregator site, and PR, primarily kidsâ€™ television. The company has just launched TV commercials in the UK and will be launching branded prepaid cards in Sainsbury’s nationwide in October.\r\n\r\nMiniMonos has been going for two years and is led by a solid and committed team of startup veterans; the CEO, Melissa Clark-Reynolds, has more than 20 years of experience as a successful entrepreneur. MiniMonos raised initial capital in New Zealand and is also incorporated in the US and the UK.",

We offer our clients all necessary software (back and front-end, inc. mobile), hardware and a network infrastructure to connect their operations - fleet, client or mixed -to other players in their city, country and worldwide. This allows mobility providers to provide a better service to users (more available vehicles accessible through a single account anywhere they need it) and to be more profitable doing so, since system-wide occupancy rates can be measured and optimised by Mobiag to ensure the balance between quality of service and profitability. This approach will, ultimately, help speed-up the on-going change in the way people think about cars bringing on a new \"use not own\" mentality with huge positive impacts for society.",

  "description": "Monetizr is a blockchain-based game reward engine powered by Ethereum to enhance the experience for gamers and benefit game developers via stronger engagement, retention, monetization and lifetime value (LTV).\r\n\r\nMonetizr bridges the gap between the digital and physical world. Monetizr enables game developers to reward their most loyal gamers for their time and acquired skill with MTZ tokens, which incentivize gamers to engage more and play longer.  Gamers earn MTZ tokens by discovering and playing games they love, and the MTZ tokens can be exchanged for game-related physical products or to other cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nUnlike other gaming currencies, Monetizr uses machine learning to identify gamer personalities across the gaming ecosystem. The MTZ tokens provide game developers unique insight from gamer feedback and data gathered in a decentralized manner across multiple games, genres and platforms. This “universal profile” is used to enhance the experience for gamers, empower game developers to build better games, and extend the reach for brands.\r\n\r\nJoin our token sale! https://www.monetizr.io/",

Similar to residency for a doctor, aspiring therapists have to complete two years of post-degree consultation with a more seasoned therapist. However, these hours are often difficult to find and really expensive.  Congruent with the rise of telehealth, 45 states now allow clinical supervision hours to be obtained online through live video-conference. \r\n\r\nMotivo has created a marketplace of available clinical supervisors.  Aspiring therapists are able to search and match with their ideal supervisor through a proprietary algorithm.  Motivo then provides the supervisor and therapist with access to a HIPAA-compliant platform for scheduling appointments, conducting video sessions, documenting notes, collecting payment, and tracking collected hours.",

  "description": "Problem \r\nResidential construction is the largest US industry to have avoided technology disruption.  Homes account for 25% of carbon emissions and are full of toxic materials.  Construction labor markets are tighter than ever, resulting in a housing crisis in many cities. Boeing can assemble a 737 in 10 days, why does it take us so long to build a house?\r\n\r\nSolution \r\nNODE isn't a builder - we’re a housing systems company, and here’s what makes us different: Our purpose is to bring deeply sustainable homes to the masses.  We do this through a scalable system that slashes time and cost.  We're making this real. \r\n\r\nTechnology\r\nOur technology that unlocks the ability to scale is what we call Slide-Click-Lock (SCL). A system engineered for simplicity, and flexible enough to deliver unique designs.  It’s on-site assembly, not construction.  SCL enables massive efficiencies and solves the labor problem by unlocking a new workforce. Our vision is that just about anyone, with a bit of training,  can assemble a NODE. We're targeting 4 people, 1 month at half the cost of traditional construction.  It doesn't end there. Bringing the cost down with a highly scalable system allows NODE to be a platform for technology.  We're developing a design online platform, a distributed + shared energy model, and something we like to call Housing as a Service (HAAS). \r\n\r\nTraction  \r\nTwo projects delivered, 3 in design.  Revenue: $650K to date. 2.5M in contract for 2018.  LOI with a developer for a sustainable community outside Seattle, WA including 70-105 units, roughly 15M in revenue for 2020. Strategic Partnership for prototyping and sales with a Seattle based infill developer who completes 60-100 doors a year. \r\n\r\nBusiness Model \r\nNODE is not a builder: we are a technology platform (patent pending)  that holds the brand and customer interface, designs, IP, ensures quality, manages a supply chain and delivers a building kit, and arranges the crowdsourced labor to build. We are combining our core Slide-Click-Lock technology with several horizontal tech platforms to create a novel full stack approach for a new customer experience.",

Our team is young and hungry, and has the perfect mix of investment banking, trading, and enterprise software experience.

In a nutshell, PadSplit takes one unaffordable home and creates a shared living experience to make it more affordable for more people, while also increasing profitability for landlords. The company was established in 2017 by Atticus LeBlanc, who has acquired and managed over 500 affordable housing units since 2008 and running shared-living homes since 2009.  Over this time period, he witnessed first-hand the decline of affordability in Atlanta as well as the prevalence of substandard living conditions for thousands of renters across the area.  To address these issues, Mr. LeBlanc sought a new solution that aligns incentives of real estate investors motivated by financial returns, local jurisdictions desirous of safe, attractive housing, and residents in need of permanent affordability.",

  "description": "Qualia has built a software platform that enables people living with chronic diseases to better manage their health. Qualia bridges the gap between healthcare and consumer-grade sensor technologies, using data from sensors like Fitbit and patient feedback to enable people to better track and manage their health. Our software platform uses this data to measure the overall health status of patients, by asking them specific questions about their Quality of Life. With this information, we empower both patients and providers to improve patient health while also reducing costs.\r\n\r\nFor Patients\r\n\r\nQualia’s app helps patient manage data from sensors like a Fitbit activity monitor, Withings scale, and iHealth blood pressure cuff. Qualia also prompts the patient to answer questions about their Quality of Life, an important outcome measure for their providers to track. Together, this information is used to provide patients with a greater ability to control the aspects of their life that drive changes in their quality of life.\r\n\r\nFor Providers\r\n\r\nQualia gives providers a better tool for optimizing their patients Quality of Life. With this information, providers can effectively manage patients between visits, thus resulting in better overall care for the patient at lower costs.\r\n\r\nProviders use the data as a decision support tool that allows them to quickly understand the status of their patients. Providers are overwhelmed with information already and our team’s background in healthcare allows us to fit this information seamlessly into a provider’s workflow.",

  "description": "We are developing a novel sensor with personalized analytics to monitor a user’s Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) by continuously detecting alcohol diffused through your skin. We intend for this technology to be integrated by other wearable manufacturers. When combined with additional user information, the data from this sensor allows us to provide estimations for the peak BAC reached, time to detox, and number of drinks consumed in a drinking session. This is actionable information for a user, enabling a previously impossible understanding one’s drinking habits, and history, and providing a valuable pivot with other health and fitness data. Ultimately, these insights help drive more informed decisions. \r\n\r\nAs a platform company, rather than directly competing in a saturated market for single function wearables, we intend to elevate the capabilities of existing wearable devices by licensing this technology. With this in mind, we have created a development platform to iterate quickly on sensor and software design. This test platform mimics a wearable in size, form, and function. The software stack consists of a phone application, cloud backend for user and sensor data, and a series of scripts which mine our backend. Hardware design is focused on the sensor housing and skin contact-points. Data integrity is ensured through thorough test procedures informed by industry veterans. To protect our developments, we are developing provisional patent applications with the help of Scott Weston of Cooley LLP",

The only way to solve this problem is to \"relovv\" our clothes, and give them a 2nd life, thereby reducing their carbon footprints by 73%.\r\n\r\nRelovv is the new, sustainable fashion marketplace (peer-to-peer). Unlike our luxury, mommy-focused competitors, relovv focuses on the younger Gen-Z consumer and their \"under $30\" price point. These items typically have under 7% sell through on our competitors platforms, but on relovv we sell through an industry high 33% of items. Relovv is not just the name of our app, it is also the name of our patent-pending feature which allows members to sell each other's items and earn money when they sell. Therefore, the entire community works together to sell each other's items and #ReduceReuseRelovv.",

In doing so, Renewal Mill, the recent winner of IFT's Food Disruption Challenge, is reducing waste and improving nutrition. Partnering with its first pilot facility, Hodo Foods, in Oakland, CA, Renewal Mill uses its proprietary technology to upcycle the byproduct of soymilk manufacturing, called okara, into a high protein, high fiber, gluten free flour. The company uses that flour to create baked good products that are currently sold at convenience stores in the Bay Area and can be found at tech companies such as Google, Lyft, and Slack. Renewal Mill will soon be in nationwide distribution and has already started work on additional byproduct sources from other nuts and legumes. The company is 100% female run and believes that a core part of its mission is to bring its high quality nutrition and chef-developed products to food deserts first.",

In fact, today, the average teen checks their smartphone every 6 minutes, to ensure they don’t miss a critical message.As social messaging continues to boom, the physical world around us also continues to thrive. This creates an interesting dilemma when we encounter situations where it is not acceptable or convenient for our smartphones to be out. \r\n\r\nEnter ringblingz.

Furthermore, Roby learns from users feedback to find the optimized setpoints to minimize thermostat battles. Roby then notifies anyone that reported the same issue when it is resolved, freeing up staff from ticket management to focus on results. This results in 20% labor savings for HR, IT and office management.

  "description": "People love music. How are people enjoying music these days? Streaming. 100 million streaming users with 50% year on year growth. The revolution started on desktop and marched on to the mobile. Home audio is the next frontier. People have speakers. But they don't connect to internet, they don't have wifi and they don't stream. The system is broken. Over 50 streaming services and more than 500 major home audio manufacturers, and no universal solution in the industry. That's why we made ROCKI. \r\n\r\nROCKI PLAY, the consumer solution - simply plug in the small & compact sized ROCKI PLAY into any home audio and turns it into a wifi streaming speaker system. You can enjoy all your music on every speakers. Launched successfully on Kickstarter in Dec 2013 with $220K and 2300 backers, the product has been shipping since Mar 2014, now available on Amazon, The Grommet, and with 10 distributors across in USA and Europe. We've sold & ship 10,000 units. This is the beginning. \r\n\r\nWith the successful entry of ROCKI into the consumer market, ROCKI is scaling up to become that universal solution for the industry. We're raising the bar - we've developed our own MultiSync (play music across multiple speaker synchronized) which can be applied to a wireless multiroom home audio system or a wireless multichannel surround sound system. We're being pulled into discussions by potential partners to put ROCKI technology in new speakers, cars and hotels. ROCKI is building the future of music - connectivity and accessibility, and we're building our future in Boston. ROCKI on!",

Students are saddled with stacks of paperwork, repetitive forms, and a barrage of postage and transcript fees, all of which undermine scholarships’ missions and discourage students from submitting applications in the first place.\n\nScholarships should be simpler.

  "description": "CDNs are the last bastion of the web application delivery stack to be integrated with agile development workflows.  All other CDNs support waterfall Dev practices. They are physical networks which exist in production and completely outside development environments.  Developers and ops teams can experience \"finger pointing\" when application code deployed from dev or test to production does not work cohesively with the production CDN.  Often, as a result, the valuable performance, scalability or security features of the CDN can be toned down or turned off.\r\n\r\n \r\nsection.io means development teams can build web software with a binary equivalent of the production CDN running in their development environment.  This in turn means developers can build applications which are CDN aware and where every app code deploy will work harmoniously with the configuration of the CDN. Ops teams can safely and reliably tune and configure the CDN in their local Dev environment to provide the maximum application performance and security improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupporting Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment principles, Dev and Ops teams deploy section.io's CDN using familiar Git commit processes.  section.io also provides a real time metrics and logging platform (Graphite, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash) providing teams with the same logs and metrics in Dev, Test and Prod environments.\r\n \r\n\r\n\\section.io has operations in Sydney (Australia) and Boulder and customers including Mazda, Thrifty Car Rental and Nike.",

  "description": "Microloans are small loans extended to individuals without access to traditional business loans (usually poor women with little education, the people often left outside of traditional economies). Seeds allows gamers to make microloans to entrepreneurs in East Africa (and eventually everywhere!), where we have strong relationships, community trust, and a safe system of loan disbursal. Microloans go directly to entrepreneurs, like Pablina in Paraguay, in need of capital.\r\n\r\nPablina is a mother of nine. She took out a $4 loan and used it to buy more flour and butter to make sugar cane cakes, which she sells at the roadside in front of her home. When her youngest son, Matias, was diagnosed with cancer, doctors predicted that he had a 10% survival rate, but he managed to pull through. Pablina's microbusiness allowed the family to stay financially afloat after spending all of their money to cover Mati's medical bills.\r\n\r\nWhen you see special Seeds packs in your favorite games, purchase the pack to contribute to a Seeds microloan to a person like Pablina. You're rewarded by the game in the form of bonus coins or special goods!",

  "description": "SIEMonster is the brainchild of a team of professional hackers with over 20 years’ experience hacking into companies around the world. Using this experience, SIEMonster has built modern security SIEM tools for companies wanting to detect threats and risks to their organization. SIEMonster is an Enterprise-grade Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), built on scalable, components. We have included features like Human Based Behavior Analytics, external Threat Intelligence and modern alerting to Slack Channels. With all the security tools entering the market we have kept our product vendor neutral to allow our customers to incorporate their existing tool suite. This gives our customers a one stop shop to all their tools. \r\n \r\nIt all began when a global manufacturer detailed their frustrations at the exorbitant licensing costs of commercial SIEM products and asked whether we could build a SIEM to minimize these annual license fees. We thought that was a great idea, and set out to build a SIEM that we would also use. SIEMonster now provides SIEM products for Managed Security Providers (MSSP’s) and Security Professionals around the world including a new range of Micro SIEM devices called Redback.",

For this service, we'll be collaborating with doctors at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance to screen drugs on their patients' cells and provide valuable data which can augment and tailor patient care. We believe our approach - partnering with consumers - can not only provide valuable services to individuals but also collect information on the population, which allows us to continue to innovate and develop new technologies.

  "description": "There is a great inefficiency in the airline industry, leaving nearly 20% of seats empty worldwide. The habits of travelers are beginning to change to be more last minute, and current booking systems to not provide an adequate, streamlined way to do this inexpensively. \r\n\r\nTo solve the inefficiency in the airline industry, we showcase last minute flights to a select target of spontaneous travelers. With the membership model of $199 a month and $35, $75, or $120 per flight, all costs are already known to a member.  This solves frustration, creates predictability, and allows for more travel.\r\n\r\nFor airlines, it allows tickets that would otherwise go unsold to be filled by last minute travelers. Airlines make revenue on those seats, thus reclaiming some of the missed revenue opportunity they currently face. \r\n\r\nOur team is a close group of talented technologists, product thinkers, and designers that have already launched products to market that millions of consumers use. That coupled with a set of advisors skilled at running companies and with specific airline expertise, we have a team perfect for executing on the long term vision of SkyHi. \r\n\r\nWe've already brought this product to market, have loyal members, and are years ahead of any competition from a regulatory standpoint.",

Students told their friends about it and it quickly spread to other schools. Student Spill, LLC was born in June of 2009 to be a broker of anonymous empathy. It provides colleges and universities with customized reporting on the prevalence of student struggles on campus, how their students compare to those of other institutions, and trending of key vulnerabilities throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nThough the platform was restricted to member schools in its early years, any student can now “spill” at www.spillnow.com and receive responses from peers.",

Offering a wide range of products increases traffic and potential revenue, but it also implies more stock-outs. Today’s e-commerce suffers from a huge loss on profit due to stock-outs.\r\n\r\nStockly is a technology allowing e-retailers to increase sales, reducing stock-outs. When a product is out-of-stock on an e-retailer's website, they can keep selling it to their consumers, and it will be shipped by an other retailer of Stockly network.\r\nExample: a user wants to buy a product on e-retailer “A“ (without Stockly) but it is out of stock. He cannot buy and leaves.\r\nHowever, if e-retailer “A“ is part of Stockly network, the user won’t see that the product is out of stock, he will be able to buy it, and it will be directly shipped by an e-retailer “B“ of the network.\r\n\r\nOur approach to the stock-out problem is data-driven and mathematical. There is at this point no established solution for e-retailers targeting specifically the stock-outs problem. There are several types of companies in the competitive landscape (such as integrators, marketplace tools and drop-shipping solutions)\r\nOur solution is a network which involves high potential revenue and defensibility.",

  "description": "Story2 is on a mission to improve students’ college and career readiness through storytelling. \r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2008, founder Carol Barash was in charge of Development and Marketing at CUNY’s tuition-free Macaulay Honors College. When the economy crashed, her students found themselves shut out of competitive jobs and internships. She had just read Daniel Pink’s book, A Whole New Mind. She worked with a professional storyteller to develop a program that taught students to tell their stories in the career process. \r\n\r\nOvernight the students’ outcomes changed! When they used personal stories to create a bridge from their past to their future, their emails got answered; they got interviews; they got jobs.\r\n\r\nCarol left CUNY and returned to her roots in EdTech. She spent two years studying the neuroscience of storytelling and testing how tools from oral storytelling could be used to improve students’ speaking, writing and collaboration. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Story2 launched courses in NYC schools to students in the college admissions process. In 2012 Story2 codified its Moments Method(R) curriculum through a pilot course with Yale University and Bridgeport Public Schools. Students across the academic spectrum--including English Language Learners--demonstrated dramatic writing improvements working with Story2.\r\n\r\n12,000 students later, in 2014, Story2 won a spot in the Kaplan EdTech accelerator run by TechStars, hired CTO Moshiur Tarafdar--who had previously led development for Princeton Review, Unigo and 2U--and pivoted from in-person to online teaching. They’ve taught more than 25,000 students to tell their stories out loud and advocate for themselves in school, work and life. Story2 has been widely recognized for its innovative online EssayBuilder™, and was recently featured by Forbes as one of “10 EdTech Companies You Need to Know About.”",

Rural farmers without access to the Internet can participate directly or indirectly in the marketplace and payments solution. Tech4Farmers promotes transparency throughout the value chain, while reducing operational and transactional costs for farmers and traders. In one sub-sector in the agricultural space a total of $500 Million is spent per annum on rice being imported into East Africa. This happens despite constraints in market access and a lack of affordable finance available to farmers. The latter leads to the exploitation of local farmers. According to a report released by the Word Bank Group in 2013, the agribusiness industry in Africa is worth an estimated $313 Billion and is expected to reach $1 Trillion by 2030.",

  "description": "Big data is being used in everything from early cancer diagnosis, self-driving cars technology and even your email's spam filter! However big data infrastructure is not affordable for those who desperately need it. There are thousands of companies who have outgrown Excel and traditional databases who now need big data solutions, however, they lack the expertise and resources to roll out their own in-house data infrastructures. \r\n\r\nSetting up an infrastructure required to handle terabytes of streaming data per day would require on average, a $500,000 up-front investment and $200,000 a year in maintenance. Assuming companies can somehow afford and hire the talent required to build and maintain such system, they will have already wasted 6 months of valuable go-to-market time and a lot of money on a system that might not even work properly.\r\n\r\nTerrene offers faster, cheaper and more accessible big data infrastructure to those who need it. We have managed to cut down the initial setup time from 6 months to less than 5 minutes while cutting down the initial setup cost to zero dollars.\r\n\r\nTerrene offers you a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for our services. With Terrene you pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. Terrene's pricing is similar to how you pay for utilities like water or electricity. You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.",

  "description": "Company Summary\r\nFor businesses looking to accelerate their search for the perfect coworking office, Upsuite takes the guesswork out of finding and selecting the office that is the perfect fit for their business. Unlike Googling for offices, and reviewing individual websites, Upsuite is matchmaking service for coworking that saves time and is free to use. Upsuite’s mission is to help teams do their best work. Upsuite currently operates in Denver and Toronto.\r\n\r\nManagement Team\r\nUpsuite is led by Ben Wright, a three-time founder. His previous businesses included digital marketing and SaaS offerings for the commercial real estate industry. The Upsuite team brings more than 40 years of combined experience within digital marketplaces and more than 20 years working in the coworking industry. Advisors include Dylan Taylor, COO of Colliers, David Mandell (Pivot Desk), others from Liquid Space, Reonomy, JLL, and Vend. \r\n\r\nCustomer Problem\r\nCoworking operators report that finding and qualifying new teams is the largest challenge they are facing. This is driven by their 40% average vacancy. \r\nCorporate teams are presented with hundreds of options for coworking in at least 20 North American markets today. With an average length of stay of 18 months, 2/3 of teams start looking for new options each year, often resorting to Google searches or individual operator websites.\r\n\r\nProducts & Services\r\nThe Upsuite marketplace connects thousands of coworking operators to the hundreds of thousands of corporate teams who like the flexible leases and employee friendly environments that coworking provides. Using Upsuite, operators receive a steady stream of teams walking into their facility, who are ready to buy. Upsuite is the easiest way for corporate teams to select coworking spaces in their market.\r\n\r\nTarget Market\r\nCorporate teams of 2-20. Corporate teams will spend $100 billion on coworking by 2030, according to JLL. Coworking, defined by shorter term leases, has become a $14 billion industry, with revenue coming from solopreneurs, startups, and corporate teams. According to JLL, coworking will be 30 % of corporate office portfolios by 2030 - making corporate teams the fastest growing segment of the market going forward.\r\n\r\nBusiness Model\r\nThe Upsuite business model is scalable, profitable for Upsuite and our operators. One signed lease generates $24,000 in revenue for our operator partners.",

  "description": "In technical terms, Voxon’s technology is a volumetric display. At its core is an ultra high-speed digital light engine and a highly optimized volume rendering engine. This unique combination of hardware and software is capable of projecting over half a billion points of light every second into physical volumetric space.\r\n\r\nGeometry that is being rendered is sliced up into hundreds of digital horizontal cross sections before being projected synchronously onto a specially designed high speed reciprocating screen. As the photons of light hit the screen, they are diffused and reform a physical cross sectional image at precisely the right place in physical space. Through persistence of vision, the human eye blends hundreds of layers together, and the result is a true three-dimensional (3D) volumetric holographic representation of data that can be viewed in the same way as one would view a real object, from any angle, and without special effects, goggles or glasses.",

  "description": "WebCurfew is the first cloud offering that provides a solution to modern parents’ biggest problem, how to set reasonable boundaries on their children’s home internet access. \r\n\r\nClassical approaches to internet parental control solutions have required parents to be an IT pro to download, install, configure and manage software that is installed on the device to be controlled.  However, in today’s modern internet home kids are accessing the internet from a litany of devices from within the home (PCs, phones, mp3 players, tablets, game consoles, …).  As a result parents are struggling to keep up.  Clearly, a device-centric, software-based parental control solution is no longer practical. \r\n\r\nWebCurfew's approach is 100% cloud-based, talking directly to the routers people already have in their home.   WebCurfew “programs” these routers to turn off access to any internet enabled device that connects to it. Our platform for remote controlling consumer routers allows us to create a single intuitive \"Control Panel\" abstraction on a web page/mobile phone for displaying all of the internet enabled devices in the home.  Parents can then turn off/on the internet access for each device, in real-time at a click of a button. It’s like having a separate \"light switch\" for all your kids internet devices. \r\n\r\nWebCurfew is the world’s first global consumer-oriented home automation application. However, rather than controlling small appliances and living room lights, WebCurfew users are controlling the internet access to their children's devices.  Today WebCurfew supports over 100 consumer-based routers with more being added every week.",

A travel application, for example, might combine routing, booking, and payment services from providers such as Rome2Rio, Expedia, and Stripe. Developers need to visit the developer portal of each provider, write their own “middleware” to combine these services and maintain their integration whenever any provider makes changes. XapiX enables developers to consume 3rd party services through a single, configurable point of contact in the cloud. Developers are able to create connectors to any existing API and share it with the community.

  "description": "Education is going to change more in the next 20 years than it has in the last 2,000 and as it changes the sophistication of the algorithms and technology powering these apps is increasing as well as the cost of developing this technology.  Indeed the leading players in the market have invested millions of dollars in their technology stack.   Zzish is an infrastructure and toolset for developers to build state-of-the-art mobile learning apps for a fraction of the time and cost it would take otherwise.  We help developers build better learning apps, faster and at lower cost allowing them to leverage our $2m stack to deliver apps that are both engaging and effective.\r\n\r\nOur toolset includes a number of core features, including adaptive algorithms (to create personalising learning experiences), gamification, such as avatars, leaderboards and multiplayer game play (to increase student engagement and motivation),  app analytics our \"Google Analytics for learning apps\" (for measuring engagement and learning effectiveness of apps), personal learning analytics (for giving students, teachers and parents insight into their learning progress and performance), and classroom-ready (to make an app suitable for use in the classroom).\r\n\r\nOur Learning Hub lets students, teachers and parents collect and view data from all the apps that use the platform in one central place.  It also acts as a distribution channel for education app developers to reach new users and lets students discover apps that are proven to be effective at helping them learn specific topics.",
